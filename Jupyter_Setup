#Jupyter Global Access Setup 
if: you have installed anaconda distribution follow below steps
else: then follow this link to install anaconda https://github.com/egnsuresh/Python/blob/master/anaconda_setup

step1: login to linux using ssh connection or which is easy to you open terminal
      1.1: before Jupyter setup we should enable ssl for it by creating self signed certificate
          to create self signed certificate in linux follow below instructions
      1.2: creating .pem file for self signed certificate
           commands: mkdire certs
                     cd certs
                     sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certkey.pem -out certkey.pem
            after running above command it will asks inputs from you, enter appropriate info and finish.

      1.3: Jupyter configuration with self signed certificate
            command: cd ~/.jupyter/
                    vi jupyter_notebook_config.py
                    (now editor will open)
                    enter click on insert key from keyboard: it will change the mode to insert then we can add text, which is given below
                    c = get_config()
                    c.NotebookApp.certfile= u'/home/<username>/certs/certkey.pem'
                    c.NotebookApp.ip='*'
                    c.NotebookApp.open_browser=False
                    c.NotebookApp.port=9898
                    now save the file by enterning following commands
                    click on escape key from keyboard and enter colon symbol from key board and enter wq to quit the writing 
                    
                   explination: c=get_config(): to get the configuration into variable called c
                                c.NotebookApp.certfile=u'here wee need provide where path to .pem file which is generated on step1.2
                                c.NotebookApp.ip='*': this is to host our jupyter notebook to all the alias name of our machine
                                c.open_browser=False: not to open browser by default, her F in False always caps
                                c.port=9898: give your own post number to run this notebook give unique one which is not used by 
                                                any other app this machine

step2: now run the jupyter notebook by entering below command
      command: jupter notebook
              if no error then it will shows url of  notebook to access it.
              take that url and access from using any machine.
              if any error occured and ending with permission then execute following commnads and try again
          
              cd ~/certs/
              sudo chmod 777 certkey.pem
              here certkey.pem is certificate name we given in step1.2
